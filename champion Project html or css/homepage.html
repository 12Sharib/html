            The human body is the structure of a human being. It is composed of many different types of cells that together create tissues and subsequently organ systems. They ensure homeostasis and the viability of the human body.

It comprises a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), arms and hands, legs and feet.

The study of the human body involves anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.

The body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and by artists to assist them in their work.

Weight training
Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.

It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, prevent aging, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.

In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age
of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none

            Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's muscles by muscle hypertrophy
            for aesthetic purposes. It is distinct from similar activities such as powerlifting because it focuses on physical
            appearance instead of strength. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In
            professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses for a panel of judges who rank them
            based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation. Bodybuilders prepare for
            competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of
            extracellular dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and
            shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights.
