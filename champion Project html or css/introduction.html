        <h1>Weightlifting</h1>
        <p>
            Olympic weightlifting, or Olympic-style weightlifting (officially named Weightlifting), is a sport in which
            athletes compete in lifting a barbell loaded with weight plates from the ground to overhead, with each
            athlete vying to successfully lift the heaviest weights. Athletes compete in two specific ways of lifting
            the barbell overhead: these are the snatch and the clean and jerk. The snatch is a wide-grip lift, in which
            the weighted barbell is lifted overhead in one motion. The clean and jerk is a combination lift, in which
            the weight is first taken from the ground to the front of the shoulders (the clean), and then from the
            shoulders to overhead (the jerk). The clean and press, wherein a clean was followed by an overhead press,
            was formerly also a competition lift, but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form.

            Each weightlifter gets three attempts at both the snatch and the clean and jerk, with the snatch attempts
            being done first. An athlete's score is the combined total of the highest successfully-lifted weight in
            kilograms for each lift. Athletes compete in various weight classes, which are different for each sex and
            have changed over time. Lifters who fail to successfully complete at least one snatch and at least one clean
            and jerk fail to total, and receive an "incomplete" entry for the competition.

            Weightlifting is an olympic sport, and has been contested in every Summer Olympic Games since 1920. Whilst
            the sport is officially named "weightlifting", the terms "olympic weightlifting" and "olympic-style
            weightlifting" are often used to distinguish it from the other sports and events that involve the lifting of
            weights, such as powerlifting, weight training, and strongman events. Similarly, the snatch and
            clean-and-jerk are known as the "olympic lifts".

            While other strength sports test limit strength, olympic-style weightlifting also tests aspects of human
            ballistic
            limits (explosive strength): the olympic lifts are executed faster, and with more mobility and a greater
            range of motion
            during their execution, than other barbell lifts. The olympic lifts, and their component lifts (e.g. cleans,
            squats) and
            their variations (e.g. power snatch, power clean) are used by elite athletes in other sports to train for
            both explosive
            and functional strength.

        <h1>powerlifting</h1>
        <p>
            Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat,
            bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a
            maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport
            known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin
            to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three.

            In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as 'classic' or 'raw'
            lifting in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or
            squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not
            un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting. Weight belts,
            knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing
            equipped from un-equipped lifting.[1]

            Competitions take place across the world. Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport (bench press only) since
            1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport. Local, national and international competitions have
            also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the IPF.
