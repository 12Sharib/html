        <h1>Flex Wheeler</h1>
        <p>Kenneth "Flex" Wheeler (born August 23, 1965) is an American IFBB professional bodybuilder. He won the Arnold
            Classic
            a then-record four times and was once described by Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of the greatest bodybuilders
            he had
            ever seen. Ronnie Coleman has stated that Wheeler was the best bodybuilder he competed against.
            After a short career as a police officer, Wheeler focused full-time on becoming a professional bodybuilder.
            He competed for the first time in 1983, but it was not until 1989 that he secured a first-place trophy at
            the NPC Mr. California Championships. He placed second at the 1993 Mr. Olympia, narrowly missing a win
            (something he was to repeat in 1998 and 1999). He is a 5-time Ironman Pro winner, 4-time Arnold Classic
            winner, and has won the France Grand Prix, South Beach Pro Invitational, Night of Champions, and Hungarian
            Grand Prix.

            While Wheeler had the reputation of being arrogant and overconfident, he attributed this to a need to
            compensate for his introversion and insecurity as a child and young man.[5] In 1994, he was involved in a
            near-fatal car accident that could have left him with lifelong paralysis. Falling back into depression
            again, he started training from scratch, returning with remarkable speed to bodybuilding's top tier. In
            1999, Wheeler discovered that he had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a form of kidney disease. Despite
            press speculation as to the cause of the failure, Wheeler pointed out that the condition is hereditary,
            although drug use probably accelerated its onset. Wheeler announced his retirement from competitive
            bodybuilding in 2000, but continued to compete until 2003.

            Flex made a comeback at the 2017 Mr. Olympia, competing in the Classic Physique division, and finished at
            15th place.

        <h1>
            Arnold Schwarzenegger
        </h1>
        <p>
            Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (/ˈʃvɑːrtsnɛɡər/;[a] German: [ˈaʁnɔlt ˈʃvaʁtsn̩ˌʔɛɡɐ]; born July 30, 1947) is
            an Austrian-American film actor, former bodybuilder, producer, businessman, and former politician who served
            as the 38th governor of California from 2003 to 2011. As of 2021, he is the most recent Republican governor
            of California.

            Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15 and went on to win the Mr. Universe title at age 20,
            subsequently winning the Mr. Olympia contest seven times; he remains a prominent figure in bodybuilding, and
            has written many books and articles on it. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second-most
            important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him.

            After retiring from bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film star.
            Having previously appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977), his breakthrough film was
            the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit that resulted in a sequel in
            1984.[4] He then appeared as the title character in the critically and commercially successful sci-fi film
            The Terminator (1984), and subsequently played similar characters in the sequels Terminator 2: Judgment Day
            (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate
            (2019). He also starred in other successful action films such as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987),
            Predator (1987), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as Twins
            (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Junior (1994), and Jingle All the Way (1996), and one mixed
            action/thriller-based comedy, Red Heat (1988). He is the founder of the film production company Oak
            Productions.

            As a Republican candidate, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election
            to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of Democrat runner-up
            Cruz Bustamante. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was re-elected in
            the 2006 California gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9% to serve a full term as
            governor. In 2011, he reached his term limit as Governor and returned to acting.

        <h1>Shawn Ray</h1>
        <p>In over 30 major bodybuilding competitions, Ray only failed once to place in the top five. Signing his first
            professional bodybuilding sponsor contract in 1988, Ray has been featured in six video documentaries;
            Lifestyles of the Fit & Famous (Biopic), Final Countdown (Contest Prep for Olympia 1998), Inside & Out-
            Behind the Muscle, a look at his daily life on the Pro Circuit, To The Extreme (Training Video) Best of
            Shawn Ray (History of Shawn Ray). "Fitness After 40" which is a biographical and documentary instyle,
            showcases Ray's life after the competitive stage being married with his first child while getting back on
            the Horse and getting in shape.

            He is mentioned in The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding by Bill Dobbins and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
            Ray also wrote a book about how to become a bodybuilder, named The Shawn Ray Way. Ray has appeared on more
            Flexible Magazine covers than any bodybuilder in history and has also featured in many fitness and
            bodybuilding magazines worldwide. Ray was a co-host on Flex Magazine Workout on ESPN for 5 years as well as
            hosting bodybuilding competitions for ESPN as a commentator for 8 years.

            Ray was the Co-Master of Ceremonies for the 2006 and 2007 Mr. Olympia Competitions held in Las Vegas,
            Nevada. He is the creator of the only charity fundraiser for professional bodybuilding, Vyo Tech
            Nutritionals presents: Shawn Ray's CHOC Hospital Golf Invitational. Over the last ten years with the help of
            other pro fitness, figure and bodybuilding champions, as well as supplement companies and magazines, he has
            helped raise and donate over $55,000.00 to the Children's Hospital of Orange County by hosting this event
            annually at Black Gold Golf Club in Yorba Linda, CA.

            Ray was the first professional bodybuilder to fail the drug testing at the Arnold Classic, which was when he
            first lost the title in 1990. He went on to win the title again in 1991.

            Ray retired from competitive bodybuilding in 2001 and is now working with FasciaBlaster, Mr. Tortilla and
            Old School Bodybuilding Clothing. He placed in the top five at the Mr. Olympia competition for twelve
            consecutive years from 1990 to 2001, two of those being first runner-up finish

        <h1>Dorian yates</h1>
        <p>
            Dorian Andrew Mientjez Yates (born 19 April 1962) is an English retired professional bodybuilder. He won the
            Mr. Olympia title six consecutive times from 1992 to 1997 and has the fifth-highest number of Mr. Olympia
            wins in history, ranking behind Ronnie Coleman, Lee Haney , Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Phil Heath
            . He is widely considered to be one of the top pro bodybuilders in history, and was well known for his
            wide and thick back.

        <h1>Kevin Levrone</h1>
        <p>
            Levrone began his professional IFBB career in 1991 after finishing first in the NPC Finals. After placing
            2nd at the 1992 Mr. Olympia contest, for his first participation, he had a severe injury in February 1993,
            completely tearing his major and minor pectorals while bench-pressing 600 pounds, and he needed surgery to
            reattach them. He had two surgeries, the first one lasted 8 hours, then while he was healing he got an
            infection and he needed a second surgery. At that time everyone thought that Levrone's career was over, yet
            he managed to be in contest shape for the 1994 Mr. Olympia only eight weeks later, and placed 5th. He
            placed 2nd at Mr. Olympia four times — in 1992 and 1995 behind Dorian Yates (six times winner), in 2000 and
            2002 behind Ronnie Coleman (eight times winner).

            When he stopped competing in 2003, Levrone did not officially announce his retirement; he explained this as
            he never thought about retirement, but just decided to do something different and find other challenges.

            Despite having been away from competition for well over a decade since 2003, Kevin officially announced in
            May 2016 that he would return to once again compete at the professional level at the Mr. Olympia contest, by
            special invite; he indeed entered the 2016 Mr. Olympia contest, at age 51, and placed 17th, with only
            five months of preparation. In 2018, in the lead up to competing in the Arnold Classic Australia
            competition, Levrone announced that this would be his last competition; he placed 13th out of a field of 14.
            Many believe he had improved over his 2016 Mr Olympia condition, but he was still far from the condition
            that had made him a big name in bodybuilding in the 90s and early 2000s.

        <h1>Dexter Jackson</h1>
        <p>
            Dexter's first NPC (National Physique Committee) competition was the NPC Southern States Championship of
            1992, where he took 3rd. He first competed professionally in the 1999 Arnold Classic, Night of Champions,
            and Mr. Olympia contests, placing 7th, 3rd, and 9th, respectively.

            At the 2007 Mr. Olympia, Jackson placed 3rd and many critics said he would not likely place any higher. On
            September 27, 2008, he defeated the reigning two-time Mr. Olympia, Jay Cutler to become the 12th man to win
            the title, and only the second to have won it and the Arnold Classic title in the same year. Jackson has won
            the Mr. Olympia title once, sharing this distinction with Chris Dickerson (1982), Samir Bannout (1983),
            Shawn Rhoden (2018) and Brandon Curry (2019).

            2008 was a great year for Jackson, as he won the Arnold Classic, Australian Pro Grand Prix VIII, New Zealand
            Grand Prix, Russian Grand Prix and the Mr. Olympia. Jackson placed 3rd in the 2009 Mr. Olympia contest.

            In 2012, Jackson placed 4th in the Mr. Olympia, then surprised everyone by winning that year's Masters
            Olympia at the age of 43 and then won his fourth Arnold Classic title in 2013.

            In 2015, Jackson showed he was still a force to be reckoned with at the age of 45 when he placed 2nd at the
            Mr. Olympia; his highest placing since winning the Mr. Olympia in 2008.

        <p>
            Born and raised in Georgia, USA, Lee grew up with a fascination for bodybuilding. He idolized figures such
            as Samson from the Old Testament and Hercules from Greek Mythology, wanting to imitate their physiques.

            Lee bought countless magazines, covering his bedroom walls with posters of the bodybuilder Robby Robinson.
            He looked up to the Black Prince (Robby Robinson) and wanted to achieve a similar body.

            At the age of 12, in 1971, the future legend requested weights for his Christmas present. The set was gifted
            contained a Charles Atlas training guide – this became his source of knowledge in fitness during this time.

            Making Progress
            Lee’s weight training was his first taste of any sport as a child. But luckily, he was blessed with great
            genetics.

            After growing out of his first weight set, Lee joined his local YMCA. It was here that Danny Rogers quickly
            noticed his huge potential. He told Lee: “kid you have one of the most balanced physiques I have ever seen.
            Bodybuilding is your ticket. You can be one of the greatest bodybuilders in the world if you put your mind
            to it”.

            For the next 4 years, Danny took young Lee Haney under his wing, teaching him how to lift weights properly.
            By 1973, Lee had developed his physique considerably, becoming the biggest in his age group.

            It wasn’t long until he was invited to participate in numerous sports during high school like football,
            basketball, and athletics. However, Lee never took his focus away from sculpting his dream physique.

        <h1>Ronnie Coleman</h1>
        <p>
            Coleman's fellow officer Gustavo Arlotta suggested he attend the Metroflex gym, owned by amateur bodybuilder
            Brian Dobson. Dobson offered Coleman a free lifetime membership if he allowed Dobson to train him for the
            upcoming Mr. Texas bodybuilding competition that year.[9] After training for Mr. Texas, Coleman won first
            place in both the heavyweight and overall categories. He also defeated Dobson himself. Coleman won his first
            competition as a professional, the Canada Pro Cup, in 1995. The following year, he won the contest again,
            then went on to win the 1997 Russian Grand Prix. He also participated in powerlifting competitions in the
            mid-1990s.

            His rise at the top in the professional circuit of bodybuilding was relatively slow: for his first
            participation at the Mr. Olympia contest (the most prestigious worldwide) in 1992, he wasn't ranked; then in
            1994 he placed 15th, then 10th in 1995, 6th in 1996, and 9th in 1997 when Dorian Yates won his sixth and
            last title before retiring.[11] The following year, Kenneth Wheeler was favored to become the 10th
            individual Mr. Olympia titleholder, with predominant competition coming from Nasser El Sonbaty, Kevin
            Levrone, and Shawn Ray. However, Coleman—whose Night of Champions victory earlier in the year had
            considerably elevated his esteem in the bodybuilding world—brought substantial improvements to the stage and
            went on to defeat Wheeler by three points for his first Mr. Olympia win.[11] Coleman defended his title all
            the way through the 2005 contest, earning a total of eight consecutive victories and tying Lee Haney as the
            winningest Mr. Olympia in history. In 2001, he became the first man to win both the Arnold Classic and the
            Mr. Olympia titles the same year (only Dexter Jackson has repeated this feat, in 2008). Coleman's reign as
            Mr. Olympia came to an end in 2006 when Jay Cutler, the three-time consecutive runner-up heading into the
            contest, finally earned his first win. It was only the second time in contest history that a reigning
            multi-champion Mr. Olympia had lost his title (as opposed to retiring). The previous instance occurred when
            Arnold Schwarzenegger defeated Sergio Oliva in 1970. Coleman made his final Mr. Olympia appearance in 2007,
            placing 4th.

        <p>
            Heath entered bodybuilding in 2002. In 2005, he won the overall title at the NPC (National Physique
            Committee) USA Championships, earning the right to compete as an IFBB Pro. He won his first two IFBB
            professional events the following year: The Colorado Pro Championships and The New York Pro Championship. In
            2007, Heath placed fifth at the Arnold Classic. Although he still qualified to compete in the 2007 Mr.
            Olympia contest, Heath, nevertheless, decided not to enter the contest, stating that he needed additional
            time to improve his form.

            Heath won the 2008 Iron Man show and placed second to Dexter Jackson at the 2008 Arnold Classic. In his 2008
            Mr. Olympia debut, Heath finished third to become the first novice to place in the top three since Flex
            Wheeler in 1993. He claimed the fifth position at the 2009 Mr. Olympia title and second place at the 2010
            event. He gained the crown in 2011. Heath defended the title of Mr Olympia consecutively six times since
            then until 2018 when he placed second to Shawn Rhoden.

        <h1>
            Jay Cutler
        </h1>
        <p>
            Cutler was ranked by many experts as the third-best quarterback prospect in the 2006 NFL Draft, after Matt
            Leinart of USC and Vince Young of Texas. ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Ron Jaworski tabbed him as the best
            quarterback available in the draft, and some scouts believed he had better arm strength than Young and
            Leinart, and compared him to Brett Favre for his gunslinger attitude. At the 2006 NFL Scouting
            Combine, Cutler completed 23 repetitions of a 225-pound bench press (more than some linemen) and ran a
            40-yard dash in 4.77 seconds.

            Cutler was selected, with the 11th pick of the first round of the draft, by the Denver Broncos, who traded
            their 1st and 3rd round picks to the St. Louis Rams to move up. Many believed Cutler was chosen by the
            Broncos due to the lackluster performance in the previous season's AFC Championship Game of Jake
            Plummer.[28] After the pick by Denver, Cutler said, "We had no warning. I think I knew about 15 seconds
            before everyone else did. Cutler, as predicted by most, was the third quarterback chosen, after Young
            (3rd overall) and Leinart (10th). He is the third first-round pick to come from Vanderbilt, preceded by Will
            Wolford and Bill Wade. On July 27, 2006, Cutler agreed to terms on a six-year $48 million contract, which
            included $11 million in bonuses.
